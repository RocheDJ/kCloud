## An Android Application to interface with kCloud final Project  

---

## Description

This Demonstration application allows the user to log in and view data from industrial installations in real time using an application rather than a web site.
The project is based on a previous project I did from Mobile Development Assignment II Github [Link](https://github.com/RocheDJ/DataViewLogger/tree/Assignment-II) but with some under the hood changes.

1) Data retrieved from kCloud API server using Volly.
2) User login and registration from the same API server.
3) User can scan NFC tag to ID particular instillation.
