## Description

This Demonstration application allows the user to log in and view data from industrial installations in real time using an application rather than a web site.
The project is based on a previous project I did from Mobile Development Assignment II Github [Link](https://github.com/RocheDJ/DataViewLogger/tree/Assignment-II)

## UX /DX Approach Adopted

The UX uses the the Model Vew View Model approach using fragments from a root home page. The Nav Drawer allows for easy access to settings with a Toolbar allowing the user filter selected sites.
The settings page is mainly for demonstration "although the Firebase/Jason Switch does work", is written using jetpack compose as an embedded element in the settings resource layout.

The DX is based around JASON using both a flat file JSON for local testing and a Firebase version for remote testing.
I had planned on using an API driven backend database but I ran out of time for that.
